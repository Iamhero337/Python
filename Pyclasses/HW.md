8. WAP to check whether the given character is a vowel or consonant. If the given character is a vowel, store it inside the list; else display the ASCII character value.
9. WAP to find out the greatest of three numbers by using `elif`.
10. WAP to check whether the given character is an alphabet. Print the same character 5 times if it is an alphabet.if it is a digit then divide it by 5 and print it, and if it is a ascii value then add 5 and print it in a normal char.
11. WAP to check whether the given character is uppercase and print it by converting it into lowercase (without using functions).
12. WAP to check whether the given character is an ASCII number and print its ASCII value.
13. WAP to check whether the given character is uppercase, then print lowercase. If the given character is lowercase, print uppercase. If the given character is a special character, find its ASCII value, add 8, and convert it back into a normal ASCII character.
14. WAP to check whether the last character of the string is a special character or not.
15. WAP to check whether the middle value of a heterogeneous tuple collection is an integer or not.
16. WAP to check whether the given number is a single-digit, double-digit, triple-digit, or more than that. Then print how many digits are there.

19. WAP to check greatest of 4 numbers using `nested if`.
20. WAP to print middle value of the given heterogeneous tuple collection only if the middle value is string and having length greater than 3.
21. WAP to print first value of tuple if it is a string having length greater than 5. and that string should be palindrome.
22. WAP to print reverse string only if is starting with vowel and ending with consonant and it should have middle value.
23. WAP to print the last value of the list only if it palindrome starting with vowel.
24. WAP to print the value present in even index of tuple only if the lenght of the tuple is odd and having first value as intiger.

26. WAP to consider an input string, print the string as it is if it is a palindrome, print the reverse string if it is having even numbers of chars. print all the char in the odd  number index if the string is having odd numbers of chars.

27. WAP to print all the numbers which are divisible by 5 till 100.
